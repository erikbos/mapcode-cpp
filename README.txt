This directory contains the original C++ Mapcode sources and an application to
- encode lat/lon to Mapcodes,
- decode Mapcodes to lat/lon,
- generate 3D uniformly distributed lat/lon pairs and their Mapcodes.

To build the original Mapcode tool:
  gcc mapcode.c -o mapcode

For help, simply execute 'mapcode' without ny arguments.
