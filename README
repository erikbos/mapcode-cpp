MAPCODE LIBRARY: mapcodelib/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The directory 'mapcodelib' contains the files:

	mapcoder.h      <-- Header file with method prototypes and defines for caller.
	mapcoder.c
	basics.h

Together these provide routine to encode/decode Mapcodes.

Documentation, including example snippets of C source code, can be found in

	mapcode_library.doc     (Microsoft Word format).

Also see www.mapcode.com for background and reference materials.

Note: this version may be restricted to a particular area of the Earth!
In that case, basics.h will state a version number of the for:
	#define mapcode_cversion "1.2xxx"
where "xxx" states the geographical limitation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE: example/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The directory 'example' contains a Mapcode encoding/decoding utility, as an example
of how to use the library.

To build the original Mapcode tool, execute:

  cd example
  gcc mapcode.c -o mapcode

For help, simply execute the binary file 'mapcode' without no arguments.
This tool provides a rather extensive command-line interface to encode and
decode Mapcodes.
